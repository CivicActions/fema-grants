For example, FEMA's online ordering services for U.S. Fire Administration and the FEMA Flood Map Store publications allow users to shop through online catalogs. When a user \"checks off\" a publication, the transaction consists of a separate \"signal\" that is sent by the user's computer to FEMA's site. In order to maintain a complete record of the total order, the FEMA server sends a \"cookie\" back to the user's computer solely for the purposes of identifying that user's order. The only information collected during this process is related to that particular publication order. This information is not retained after the online order is sent or completed. FEMA's use of cookie technology is not otherwise designed, intended or used to collect, store or analyze information pertaining to Internet users.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Google Analytics<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has enabled Google Analytics on FEMA\u2019s Website(s). Google Analytics is a tool that helps the Department gather feedback using non-identifiable aggregated data such as number of unique visitors to a page and the navigation the visitor took to get to a specific piece of content. The Department will use this data to make modifications to the website to improve the user experience and monitor the traffic on the website.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to use this tool, Google sets a cookie on your machine or device.

Google Analytics does not tell the Department who you are or allow the Department to determine your identity nor does the cookie monitor or record your web usage after you leave the Department\u2019s website(s).
